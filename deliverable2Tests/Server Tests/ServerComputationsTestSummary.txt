Notes:
    --> This Server Computation test is of a method that will be used often.
        --> This essentially creates a "mock" version of elements that will be used within the project models.
        --> The mock project is then used to call "get" methods to retrieve specific information from the mock project.
    
    --> Again, JUnit's class Assert is used, returns an error if false. If true, all is given the green light.
